This is the official codebase of the paper:
[FedGCS: A Generative Framework for Efficient Client Selection in Federated Learning via Gradient-based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06312)

## Overview
**Framework overview of FedGCS:** 

1. Efficiently collecting sufficient, diverse, comprehensive and high-quality training data; 

2. Preserving the knowledge of classical client selection methods into a global continuous representation space; 

3. Searching for better representation in the learned space via gradient-based optimization; 

4. Outputting the optimal device subset via generation.
